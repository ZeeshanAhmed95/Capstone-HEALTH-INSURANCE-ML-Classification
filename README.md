## Introduction

The Health Insurance Cross-Sell Prediction project is designed to help insurance companies identify potential customers for vehicle insurance. By analyzing customer data, the model can predict whether a customer is likely to be interested in purchasing vehicle insurance, allowing the company to target their marketing efforts more effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about customers, including demographics, insurance history, and vehicle information. The dataset can be found in the `data` folder of the repository.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   - NumPy
   - Pandas
   - Matplotlib
   - Scikit-learn
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Zeeshan_Classification_Capstone_of_FINAL_HEALTH_INSURANCE_CROSS_SELL_PREDICTION.ipynb` in your preferred Jupyter environment.

## Usage

To run the project, simply open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in order. The notebook contains detailed explanations and visualizations to help you understand the data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation steps.

## Results

The project evaluates various machine learning classification models and selects the best one based on performance metrics. The results section in the notebook provides a detailed analysis of the model's performance and insights into the most important features for predicting customer interest in vehicle insurance.
